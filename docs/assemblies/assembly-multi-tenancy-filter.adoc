= (Preview) Multi-tenancy filter

[role="_abstract"]
Kroxyliciousâ€™s Multi-tenancy filter presents a single Kafka cluster to tenants as if it were multiple clusters.
Tenant-specific operations are isolated by prefixing resources with an identifier.

NOTE: This filter is currently in incubation and available as a preview. 
We would not recommend using it in a production environment.

The Multi-tenancy filter works by intercepting all Kafka RPCs (remote procedure calls) that reference resources, such as topic names and consumer group names:

Request path:: On the request path, resource names are prefixed with a tenant identifier.
Response path:: On the response path, the prefix is removed.

Kafka RPCs that list resources are filtered so that only resources belonging to the tenant are returned, effectively creating a private cluster experience for each tenant.

To set up the filter, configure it in Kroxylicious.

NOTE: For more information on Kafka's support for multi-tenancy, see the {ApacheKafkaSite}.
