A quick and dirty guide to actually releasing builds for consumption via maven central.

== Requirements
.Maven Central
* A Maven Central/Sonatype account. Accounts are created via their https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa[JIRA signup]
* Your Sonatype account needs to be granted publication permissions for the Kroxylicous project.
** One of the existing team members with publishing rights needs to raise a https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10134&issuetype=11003[JIRA ticket] to request the new account is added (or removed...). The requirements for the ticket are listed in the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/manage-permissions/[Central Docs]

Signing the builds with a GPG key is a requirement for publishing to Maven Central.

.PGP
* Ensure your PGP key is published to a public key server (for example keys.openpgp.org)
* Get your PGP key signed by the Kroxylicious project key. Rather than share a single key between project members (which has issues with revocation and re-issuing) we sign the releases individually using a key signed by the project key as a mark of trust.
* A copy of your keys short ID.

TIP: To get the short ID for your key `gpg2 --show-keys --keyid-format short $\{YOUR_KEY_LONG_ID}`

== Running a release

.Releasing Locally
. `mvn clean install`
.. We are looking for a clean and green build.
.. If it's not, shout scream and swear.
.. Think *very very* carefully if its worth proceeding. Releases are forever!
. Switch to the release version number.
.. `export RELEASE_VERSION=0.1.0`
.. `export RELEASE_API_VERSION=0.1.0`
.. `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$\{RELEASE_VERSION} -pl '!:kroxylicious-api,!:kroxylicious-filter-api'`
.. `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$\{RELEASE_API_VERSION} -pl ':kroxylicious-api,:kroxylicious-filter-api'`
.. `mvn versions:set-property -Dproperty=kroxyliciousApi.version -DnewVersion=$\{RELEASE_API_VERSION}`
.. `mvn clean install`
// .. *TODO*: Should we use the https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin[release plug-in] instead? .
.. `git add **/pom.xml`
.. `git commit -m "Release version v$\{RELEASE_VERSION}`
.. `git tag v$\{RELEASE_VERSION}`
.. `git push upstream --tags`
. `mvn deploy -Prelease -DskipTests=true -DreleaseSigningKey=<YOUR_KEY_SHORT_ID>`
.. The `release` profile enables GPG signing
.. The release profile will not run without specifying the `releaseSigningKey` property.
. Validate the release in the central Nexus instance.
.. Locate the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/#locate-and-examine-your-staging-repository[Staging repository]
.. Check that the right tree of artefacts are there, ensure there are source & docs jars.
// .. *TODO*: Using the staging repository to validate the release.
. `Close` the staging repository in the central Nexus instance, see the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/#close-and-drop-or-release-your-staging-repository[Central release docs]. This triggers the promotion from staging to being publicly available on central.
. Switch to the next version number for development.
.. `export DEV_VERSION=0.1.0`
.. `export DEV_API_VERSION=0.1.0`
.. `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$\{DEV_VERSION}`
.. `mvn versions:set-property -Dproperty=kroxyliciousApi.version -DnewVersion=$\{DEV_API_VERSIION}`
.. `git add **/pom.xml`
.. `git commit -m "Next development version v$\{DEV_VERSION}`
.. `git push`

.Releasing via the build server
**TBD**

Specifically we need to work out the commit rights and key signing for the build server.
